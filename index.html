    <h3>Background of the Problem:</h3>

    <p>Estimates from 2019 show that nearly 690 million people were hungry in that year, 
       or 8.9 per cent of the world’s population. Children and young people shoulder the 
       greatest burden of all forms of malnutrition from the poorest and most marginalized 
       communities. Worldwide, nearly half of all deaths in children under 5 are attributable 
       to undernutrition.  In 2019, 144 million children under 5, or 21.3 per cent were stunted, 
       47 million or 6.9 per cent, were wasted (of which 14.3 million were severely wasted) 
       and 38 million, or 5.6 per cent, were overweight.  Malnutrition during pregnancy can 
       also affect nutrition outcomes in children, notably one third of females aged 15 to 49 
       years worldwide were affected by anemia in 2016, with no notable change over the last 
       2 decades</p>

    <h3>What is currently being done about the Problem:</h3>
    <p>In many countries around the world, there are feeding programs that provide children 
        with nutritious meals during the school day, which can improve their health and 
        academic performance. These sorts of programs help address starvation, and support 
        the production of local food. Aside from that, governments can implement policies 
        and legislation that promotes food security and improve tha access of nutritious 
        food for small farmers, and food-giving programs to populations in a struggle to 
        obtain food. </p>
    
    <h3>Where I come in:</h3>
    <p>So with all these amazing explample of how poeople can help to prevent hunger and 
        malnutrition, where do I come in and what can I do? Well  as I am currently just a 
        student, and I only have little to no power one of the things that I can think of to 
        even the sltghtest bit help in this advocacy is to volunteer in local food programs 
        because even do it may not look like much it could also inspire the people fed to give 
        back what they were given. Another option that I could do is to donate to well-known 
        organizations like UNESCO so that they can use the total money givent to help the 
        malnutrition poeople.
