    <h3>Short Desc. about me:</h3>
    <p>I'm Chirzan Lucero, and I am the make of ths advocacy group. This group aims to assist in the giving of information about the advocacy No Hunger. We also strive to do our best in teaching other about it.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Who we are and how we started:</h3>
    <p>We are the "Helping Others Receive Care Understanding and Support" group or H.O.R.C.U.S. for short. As the name states this advocacy group help other receive care Undertstanding and support. We do this by either funding organizations the same goal. Or we can also do it on our own by going to different countries in need and supporting struggling groups of people.</p>
    <p>So with all of these activities how did H.O.R.C.U.S start? Well this group started with the Founder. Before this entire advocacy group was made he didnt even had a thoguht about helping others because he thought that it didnt really mean anything. that is until one day he woke and just suddenly strted doing it. Over time, he inspired other to do the same and thats how this group was made.</p>
